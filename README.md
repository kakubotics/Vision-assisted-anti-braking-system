# Vision-assisted-anti-braking-system
An automated vision assisted breaking system which analyses rider's environmentLfor surrounding vehicles and lanes using wide angle front and back mounted cameras to percept position and speed of surrounding vehicles with respect to riders position and assist rider to apply brake if their is any certainty of collision or accident.  The proposed system can detect vehicle speeds using convolution neural network model and image depth perception model. It can detect vehicles approaching from sideways and assist rider for subsequent actions.  THE PROPOSED SYSTEM WILL OPERATE LOCALLY WITHOUT ANY INTERNET CONNECTION OR CAN BE SAID OFFLINE.  The assistance will be provided by a simple add-on speaker attached to helmet giving real time environment analysis and subsequent actions to be taken. ex- if a vehicle is approaching from forward and if system detects any chance of collision then it will assist rider to slow down quickly and if collision is detected for threshold distance then it overrides rider's brakes to slow down immediately.
